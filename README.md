# pcpie's bhop maps
A collection of bhop maps made by me, pcpie

For each bhop map i've included the .vmf file, the .rad file, the textures and the models used, the bsp files are not included as this would take up too much space. but they can be found on my [gamebanana profile](https://gamebanana.com/members/submissions/maps/1409383)

These .vmf files should be compliable with the hammer version that comes with counter-strike: source, for now, they should also open in the hammer editor that comes with counter-strike: global offensive. Although it is unclear for how long, some converting might be nessesary for other source engine/quake engine based games.
