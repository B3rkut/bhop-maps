# pcpie's bhop maps
A collection of bhop maps made by me, pcpie

For each bhop map I've included the .vmf file, the .rad file, the textures and the models used, the bsp files are not included as this would take up too much space. but they can be found on my [gamebanana profile.](https://gamebanana.com/members/submissions/maps/1409383) Keep in mind all of these files are for the latest versions of the maps, hence the lack of suffixes like _fix or _v2

These .vmf files should be compatible with the hammer version that comes with counter-strike: source. For now, they should also open in the hammer editor that comes with counter-strike: global offensive. Although it is unclear for how long. Some converting might be necessary for other source engine/quake engine based games.

Some maps use textures or models that come with the game counter-strike: source. For copyright reasons I have not included those in the map folders. You will have to extract that data from the game itself if you want to port a map to another game.
